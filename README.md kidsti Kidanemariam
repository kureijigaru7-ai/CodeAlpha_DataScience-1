## 🌸 1. Iris Flower Classification
**Goal:** Predict the Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).  
**Dataset:** Built-in `load_iris()` dataset from scikit-learn.  
**Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier.  
**Result:**
Iris Classification completed! Accuracy: 1.00

✅ Model trained and tested successfully.

## 📉 2. Unemployment Analysis
**Goal:** Predict unemployment rate based on GDP growth.  
**Dataset:** Synthetic data (created manually).  
**Algorithm:** Linear Regression.  
**Result:**
Unemployment model trained successfully! Example prediction (GDP Growth=3): 4.81%

✅ Model works well on small test data.

## 🚗 3. Car Price Prediction
**Goal:** Predict car price using year and mileage.  
**Dataset:** Simple synthetic dataset.  
**Algorithm:** Linear Regression.  
**Result:**

Car Price Prediction model trained successfully! Predicted price (Year=2021, Mileage=15000): $12,940.00

✅ Regression model trained correctly.

## 💰 4. Sales Prediction
**Goal:** Predict sales amount from advertising budget.  
**Dataset:** Synthetic dataset.  
**Algorithm:** Linear Regression.  
**Result:**

Sales Prediction model trained successfully! Predicted Sales for $4000 budget: $20,440.00

✅ Sales forecast completed successfully.
